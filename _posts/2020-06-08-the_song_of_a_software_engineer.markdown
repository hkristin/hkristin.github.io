When I first stumbled upon the lessons on FreeCodeCamp.com, it was simply a way to pass time while I worked as an office assistant. It was a small, slow office, not exactly an inspiring place to spend the summer. As the time went on, I found a sense of calm in the daily FreeCodeCamp lessons. As an opera singer, I was used to days of new music, auditions, performances; high stakes events that had an even higher impact on my career. Coding was a new world; a binary, test driven system that seemed far from the subjective world of art and music I had lived for years. 

As a singer, I loved diving into new roles, scores and languages. I sang operas in Russian, English, French, German and Italian. I was constantly moving from one musical landscape to another. As I moved farther into the world of music, I realised that while music is full of beauty and meaning, it is not always connected to the daily realities of today. While heading into a practice room to get swept up in a new aria provided emotional fulfillment, it did not always provide the stability I yearned for in a career. As I moved from a Bachelor's of Music to a Master’s of Music, the pressures of turning my passion into my career proved exceedingly difficult. I began to consider a way I could maintain my creative energy, but also have the stability and logic that was so glaringly missing from my experience in opera performance. 

Coding provided a new frontier with familiar neighborhoods. My time learning new romance languages provided me with a language learning toolkit that paved the way for the new languages of code. Attention I usually paid to legato, was now channeled into seamless streams of code, that when practiced could bring its own form of beauty into the world. This beauty was more stable in its ability to be tested, to be right or wrong, but the essence of developing my skill in this world was the same: hard work and practice. Relentless practice. I was learning new notes, through a keyboard and platform, rather than a score. The subjectivity of music was replaced with the objectivity of code. I was able to adapt many of my skills from decades of singing to a new mode of working and creating art. 

Starting the Flatiron bootcamp was like walking into an audition unprepared. I didn’t quite know the part, but as the piano started it was up to me to pick up the tune. My first notes, or lines of code in this case, were a bit pitchy, but as I continued into my First Mile course work, I started to understand the music. Like a conductor, the lessons led me through the key steps, placing emphasis on each new skill. At times the errors seemed insurmountable, sometimes begging the question “why did I leave music at all?”. But with time, I started to find my rhythm, my ability to see the meaning in the new language, and the beauty in its composition. Natural talent was no longer a question, instead, coding required me to start from scratch. Flatiron School Bootcamp First Mile has given me a new key to sing in: Ruby. 
I am excited to delve deeper into this wonderful world of code over the next few months!


Best,
Kristin
